Hey, I’m Mehdi!  

I like thinking about weird, counter-intuitive, and sometimes ridiculous things, and when I do, I want to share them immediately :D. This website is where I dump thoughts, record what I’m learning, and occasionally post life updates.  

Expect a mix of ideas, observations, chess tricks, and the occasional rant. Basically, this is where I try to make sense of life while keeping it interesting and ad-free!
